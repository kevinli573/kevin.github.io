Discovering and making sense of relevant literature is fundamental in any scientific field. Node-link diagram-based visualization tools can aid this process; however, existing toolsâ€™ have been evaluated only on small scales. This paper evaluates Argo Scholar, an open-source visualization tool designed for interactive exploration of literature and easy sharing of exploration results. A large-scale user study of 122 participants from diverse backgrounds and experiences showed that Argo Scholar is effective at helping users find related work and understand paper connections, and incremental graph-based exploration is effective across diverse disciplines. Based on the user study and user feedback, we provide design considerations and feature suggestions for future work.
