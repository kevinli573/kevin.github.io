Stable Diffusion is a popular image generation tool that turns text prompts into fascinating visuals. However, its complex model structure and operations make it hard to understand. We present Diffusion Explainer, a web-based interactive visualization tool that explains how Stable Diffusion transforms a text prompt into an image. Our tool provides both high-level summaries of the image generation process and detailed explanations of each component's low-level operations by animating the transition across multiple levels. Diffusion Explainer is developed using modern web technologies and runs locally in users' web browsers, making it accessible to a wider audience. Diffusion Explainer is available at the following public demo link: https://poloclub.github.io/diffusion-explainer. A video demo is available at https://youtu.be/bIQz72w-XaU.
